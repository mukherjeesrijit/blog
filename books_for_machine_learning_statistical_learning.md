# Books for Machine Learning and Statistical Learning

Before you start, you have to understand how knowledge progresses. A researcher invents/creates a new concept in the form of a research paper, after which learners create blogs and videos, and authors create organized books, after filtering multiple thought processes, and avenues with a specific process, step by step. Then, more blogs, videos, and articles are born one by one at an exponential rate. Essentially, the source is the same, and the knowledge branches out in multiple ways, and multiple thought processes. And yes, you should take part in the process to create your understanding of the subject. Yes, you can write a book, article, blog, etc. But the goal is to understand the concepts yourself and make your notes, not to share, not to increase your following, but to purely understand yourself, from your point of view and simplify the understanding and the process of learning for yourself and others. This method has the name "The Feynman Technique". Search about it. Learning comes first. Ideating and Writing down your Notes come second. Sharing by simplifying comes third. But, this creates a complete loop of consuming and sharing knowledge. And, this should take time. And that's what makes learning hard.

# Process

The process is simple. You will have a main set of books to learn. If the book is not available, then you have to go through research papers and create your notes. But let's assume that there are books on the subjects. Gather a list of books on the subject. Start reading. Do the exercises. Do the coding. Do the exercises. Do the coding. Till it makes sense. Write down notes in your diary/copy. Just make sure that you understand the concepts fully. If the books cannot make you understand, read about the concept from Google blogs, videos, blogs, and resources. But make sure you understand the concept. Thus I will give you several books to start the process of learning. This will take time, but once you learn, it will never leave you.
