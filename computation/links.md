I have been recently interesting in computing, because as you try to understand more about machine learning, you discover that three ingredients are very important
* deterministic mathematical thingking (where it is 1 or 0)
* stochastic mathematical thinking (where it is any number between 0 to 1)
* algorithmic thinking (generalizing mathematical thinking into machine thinking for solving human problems at a large scale)
