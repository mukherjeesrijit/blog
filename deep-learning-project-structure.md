# Deep Learning Project Structure

This document outlines the main files typically in a deep learning project, organized sequentially based on their roles.

## 1. Configuration File (`config.py`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized place to store hyperparameters and configuration settings.
- **Details**:
  - Defines hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc.
  - Contains paths for data directories, model checkpoints, and logs.
  - Includes settings for data augmentation, model architecture variations, and training specifics.
  - Facilitates easy modification and experimentation by changing values in one place.

## 2. Data Utilities (`data_utils.py`)
- **Purpose**: Functions for data loading, preprocessing, augmentation, and splitting.
- **Details**:
  - Functions to read data from various formats (CSV, JSON, Excel, etc.).
  - Functions to clean and preprocess data, such as handling missing values and normalizing features.
  - Augmentation techniques for increasing the diversity of training data (e.g., rotations, flips, scaling).
  - Data splitting functions to create training, validation, and test datasets with stratification if needed.

## 3. Dataset Script (`dataset.py`)
- **Purpose**: Custom dataset classes and data loaders for specific datasets.
- **Details**:
  - Extends framework-specific dataset classes (e.g., `torch.utils.data.Dataset` in PyTorch).
  - Handles loading data into memory and providing batches during training.
  - Implements methods to transform data samples and perform on-the-fly augmentations.
  - Manages large datasets efficiently, potentially using lazy loading techniques.

## 4. Model Definition (`model.py`)
- **Purpose**: Defines the neural network architecture, including layers and the forward pass.
- **Details**:
  - Constructs the model by stacking layers, defining activation functions, and setting up connections.
  - Supports multiple model architectures through modular design (e.g., ResNet, CNN, RNN).
  - Includes methods for the forward pass, where the input data is processed through the network.
  - Optionally includes helper functions for initializing weights and configuring layers.

## 5. Utility Functions (`utils.py`)
- **Purpose**: General utility functions for logging, checkpoint management, and visualization.
- **Details**:
  - Logging utilities to track training progress, hyperparameters, and metrics.
  - Checkpointing functions to save and load model states during training.
  - Visualization tools for plotting training curves, confusion matrices, and feature maps.
  - Helper functions for common tasks like converting data formats, calculating metrics, and managing directories.

## 6. Training Script (`train.py`)
- **Purpose**: Handles the training loop, including loss computation, backpropagation, and optimization.
- **Details**:
  - Sets up the training loop to iterate over epochs and batches.
  - Computes loss using a specified loss function and updates model weights through backpropagation.
  - Optimizes the model parameters using an optimizer (e.g., SGD, Adam).
  - Tracks training progress with metrics and optionally implements early stopping.
  - Saves model checkpoints and logs training information.

## 7. Evaluation Script (`evaluate.py`)
- **Purpose**: Evaluates the trained model on validation or test data.
- **Details**:
  - Loads the trained model and validation/test data.
  - Computes performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.
  - Visualizes evaluation results with plots and tables.
  - Identifies and analyzes misclassifications or poor predictions.
  - Optionally integrates cross-validation and other validation techniques.

## 8. Inference Script (`inference.py`)
- **Purpose**: Performs inference on new data using the trained model.
- **Details**:
  - Loads the trained model and processes input data for prediction.
  - Performs necessary pre-processing on the input data (e.g., normalization, resizing).
  - Runs the forward pass to generate predictions.
  - Applies post-processing to the model outputs (e.g., thresholding, decoding labels).
  - Optionally integrates batch inference for efficiency in processing large datasets.

## 9. Experiment Management (`run_experiment.py`)
- **Purpose**: Manages different experiments, often using configuration files to change hyperparameters and settings.
- **Details**:
  - Reads configuration settings from `config.py` or external configuration files.
  - Sets up and runs experiments with different hyperparameters and settings.
  - Logs experiment results for comparison and analysis.
  - Supports systematic experimentation with automated variation of hyperparameters.
  - Optionally integrates with experiment tracking tools like MLflow or Weights & Biases.

## 10. Visualization (`visualization.py`)
- **Purpose**: Visualizes data, model predictions, training progress, and other relevant plots.
- **Details**:
  - Functions to plot training and validation loss curves over epochs.
  - Tools to visualize model predictions and compare them with ground truth labels.
  - Methods to generate confusion matrices, ROC curves, and other performance metrics plots.
  - Visualizes feature maps and activations within the neural network layers.
  - Creates interactive plots and dashboards for in-depth analysis.

## 11. Scripts for Experimentation and Tuning (`hyperparameter_tuning.py`)
- **Purpose**: Automates the hyperparameter tuning process using libraries like Optuna or Hyperopt.
- **Details**:
  - Defines search spaces for hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of layers).
  - Implements optimization algorithms to explore and find the best hyperparameter combinations.
  - Tracks and logs the performance of different hyperparameter configurations.
  - Integrates with the training script to run experiments with various hyperparameters.
  - Supports both random search and more sophisticated methods like Bayesian optimization.

## 12. Main Entry Point (`main.py`)
- **Purpose**: Ties together various components and starts the training or evaluation process.
- **Details**:
  - Parses command-line arguments to determine the mode of operation (e.g., train, evaluate, infer).
  - Initializes necessary components based on configuration settings.
  - Calls the appropriate scripts (e.g., `train.py`, `evaluate.py`, `inference.py`) to execute tasks.
  - Handles setup and teardown processes, such as loading configurations and saving results.
  - Provides a user-friendly interface for running different parts of the project.
