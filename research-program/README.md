# Medical AI Community

*Note:* _This has nothing to do with my affiliation: Pennsylvania State University. This is a personal program of mine to help the medical AI community._

The goal of the medical AI community 

To join the program, kindly follow the nine steps in a disciplined manner:
* Step 1: create a [github profile here](https://github.com/) (because I want to make sure that you have an active github account)
* Step 2: star this repository (so that I know that you are interested in the program, and you did the first step.)

* Step 3: reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srijit-mukherjee/) with your github name, your background, and your CV.
  * Step 3.1: Watch [the recordings here for the Program Orientation](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYXB138yx3ioYaiEBB8vAX3FYc2cNHMBj&si=F3zZE6eu96lgeqz7).
* Step 4: join this [WhatsApp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/B9C74mG0JIgJqFyNWbMOFO) group, here. I will accept you based on your Steps 1-3.
* Step 5: get updates on my live sessions and posts in the WhatsApp group.
* Step 6: discuss in the group with peers with the same goal as you.
* Step 7: read, & interact with me on my content, and live sessions. (that's the way, I remember your name.)
* Step 8: give your best in learning, building, following the program, and researching.
* Step 9: when the right opportunity/idea comes to my mind, I will get in touch with you.

## Program Content (organization in progress)
The live research orientation sessions introduce you to a well-defined goal and research process and help you get connected to new research areas. My LinkedIn or newsletter posts may help you give insights into research, and concepts in a more deeper way. I teach the research process, that I think is the best for me, and for any researcher. Feel free to perturb it for your benefit, and let me know if you think there is a better way out. You can find the following here:

## My research, and goal
I firmly believe research is the education of the future. My research focuses on developing domain-enriched AI solutions tailored to particular diseases in medical imaging. Crafting the solutions requires a deep understanding of the imaging, the underlying disease etiology, and the foundational AI techniques. Hence, I am currently focusing on medical imaging for the research direction. I am building this research program so that I can help passionate, and hardworking students to learn, and align with the modern applied AI research processes. This will naturally help me build my research group with interested people with a strong interest in medical AI from backgrounds like Applied Mathematics (Statistics, Economics, Physics), Computer Science, and Medicine. 

## Goal of the program
The program intends to accustom the participants to learn the research process in medical AI. The program has been naturally designed to ensure tangible outcomes, that can add to your CV so that the process is practical. This program should ideally build a student for research in applied AI, specifically for medical AI, who plans to do a PhD or move into a research role. Research needs you to learn yourself, and then apply your knowledge. No one will spoon-feed you. Hence, I only share resources, so that you can learn from them and take live classes to clear your doubts and give proper directions and processes for applied AI research in the medical domain. 

This research program program is only for medical professionals, and learners/professionals, who aspire to be medical AI researchers. There are three distinct research roles: reader, applier, and researcher. I have also described a step-by-step approach for each level to learn, and produce output while presenting your work, which is an integral part of research. I have discussed them in my orientation sessions, which you can find below. Since this program is free, the program works the best for you with a good collaboration of your, and my efforts, together. I am doing my duty to help you in whatever small way, I can. The success and impact of the program depend on your effort to use it to the fullest. I will do my best to help you in the process. All the best.
