# **Research Group Framework**

## **Goals and Expectations**
### **1. Active Participation**
- Group members are expected to ask questions regularly about **learning**, **building**, and **researching AI** in the medical field.
- Engagement is key for collaboration and growth.

### **2. Mutual Responsibilities**
- **My Duty**: Organize sessions, share research ideas, and address doubts within my knowledge domain.
- **Your Duty**: Actively ask questions, share progress, and participate in discussions.

### **3. Membership Size**
- Initially, the group will remain **small and focused**.
- If it grows beyond capacity, a **core focused group** will be created to maintain quality interactions.

## **Step-by-Step Process for Engagement**

### **Step 1: Identify Your Learning Phase**
- Categorize yourself into one of these stages:
  - **Yellow Zone**: Beginner-level understanding.
  - **Green Zone**: Intermediate skills.
  - **Red Zone**: Advanced, ready for hands-on implementation and evaluation.

### **Step 2: Ask Questions Based on Your Phase**
- Raise doubts and seek guidance on:
  - How to learn effectively at your stage.
  - Resources to use for improving your knowledge.

### **Step 3: Use Recommended Resources for Learning**
- **Books**: Start with *Understanding Deep Learning* ([UDL Book](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/)) to build foundational knowledge.
- **Online Tools**: Use AI assistants like **ChatGPT** or **Google LM Notebook** for quick queries and learning.

### **Step 4: Attend Live Research Sessions**
- Participate in **monthly, biweekly, or weekly sessions** where new research ideas and topics are presented.
- Ask questions actively during these sessions to deepen understanding.

### **Step 5: Evaluation Readiness**
- After discussions and consistent participation, you and I will assess your readiness for an **evaluation phase** to gauge progress.

### **Step 6: Core Learning Activities**
- Independent learning is crucial:
  - **Learn Hugging Face's Computer Vision (CV) Course** ([Hugging Face CV Course](https://huggingface.co/learn)).
  - **Build AI Models** by reading GitHub repositories and implementing projects from scratch.

### **Step 7: Tackle the Red Zone**
- Use the live sessions to gain insights and tackle challenges in the **Red Zone** phase of learning.
